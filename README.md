## Hi!!✨
My name is Gustavo, I'm a Computer Science student and graduated in Analysis and Development of Sistems

Currently i work on two projects: 
- "Tradulibras", a website that translates portuguese to Libras (Brazilian Sign Language). I am responsible for the FrontEnd and design of the project, as well with some documentation for our university. 
- ICSH (Super Human Crimes Institute) RPG, my own RPG which has it's own website, currently displaying custom spells for the players.
